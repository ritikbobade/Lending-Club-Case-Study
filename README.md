# Lending Club Case Study 
> Lending money to applicants with a high risk of default is the primary cause of financial loss, commonly referred to as credit loss. Credit loss represents the funds a lender loses when a borrower either fails to repay or absconds with the owed money.

The primary goal is to effectively identify these high-risk loan applicants in order to minimize such loans and thereby reduce credit loss. This case study aims to achieve this by employing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for the identification of these applicants.

Conduct an in-depth analysis to comprehend the key factors or variables that drive loan defaults, namely, the indicators strongly associated with defaults. The insights gained from this analysis can be valuable for the company's portfolio management and risk assessment.
